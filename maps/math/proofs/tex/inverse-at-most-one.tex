\begin{proof}
    Suppose an element of $S$, say $a$, has both $b$ and $c$ as inverses, and suppose $e$ is the identity element of $S.$ Then $b = b\circ e = b\circ (a\circ c) = (b\circ a)\circ c = e\circ c = c.$ Therefore, if an element has an inverse, it is unique. However, an element, e.g. 0, may not have an inverse, so there is at most one inverse for each element.
\end{proof}
